# Basic Pi Projects

This folder has a few basic beginner projects and a few test projects to test if the components work or not. Check out the [raspberry pi website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/0) for more details.

## Getting Started

You will need to be able to access the pi's desktop. Take a look at this [readme](https://github.com/hi-anvi/raspberry-pi) on how to access the pi desktop.

### Components

The following are the components you will need to make the projects:

* Jumper wires
* LEDs
* LDR/Photoresistor
* Motion Sensor
* Buttons
* Buzzer
* Picamera
* Stepping Motor
* Stepping Motor Drive
* 1 Digit 7 Segment LED Display

### Running the code

Just save these files in desktop, wire the components accordingly, and run them with a command like this:

```
python3 <name of file of python>
```

Make sure you are in the folder where your files are! Eg:

```
$ python3 test_ldr.py
```

## Tips

* Take care of the wiring and if wired GPIO is different, code will not work.
* Make sure python is installed.
